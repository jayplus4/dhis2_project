Product Name: Meningitis and Mpox DHIS2 Tracking System.
Version: 40.0

Introduction:
Considering the immense amount of data that the government, hospitals, and implementing partners must manage, the DHIS2 tracking system seems to be the perfect match. This new and improved system aims to ensure information is available in the country and on the go.
The DHIS2 tracking system aids in tracking not only the occurrence of Mpox and Meningitis, but also the frequency and clients/patients’ vaccination implementation.
Meningitis is an infection and inflammation of the fluid and membranes surrounding the brain and spinal cord. These membranes are called meninges.The inflammation from meningitis typically triggers symptoms such as headache, fever, and a stiff neck.Bacteria, parasites, and fungi also can cause it. Some cases of meningitis improve without treatment in a few weeks.
Mpox is an infectious disease that can cause a painful rash, enlarged lymph nodes, fever, headache, muscle ache, back pain, and low energy. Most people fully recover, but some get very sick. Mpox is caused by the monkeypox virus (MPXV).
